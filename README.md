# D3-Challenge
## Data Journalism and D3

This task, when done including the Bonus section, represents one of the most complex and intricate works we've been challenged with thus far. 

The need to have multiple sections of the code in snyc and working together to provide the dynamic ploting using D3 proved a mental challenge just to keep track of everything. 

Our course work over the past week provided sufficient guidance to build out the basic template and with a little more research, and a little guessing, the dynamic display came into being.
